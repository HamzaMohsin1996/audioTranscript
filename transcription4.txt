okay so I am telling you like a video before that and we know we integrate some changes and we will ask you some question are you ready to give me answer yes I am ready okay my first question is overall experience what do you feel about the changes Avatar made of a based interactive interaction system the change is a pretty good like I felt in the system has been upgraded to a Good Change and I feel like the sound system has really got the things going like we can now if you are doing our task and other person has completed the task we can hear the sound and we will get to know that the other person is already done with it so it's a Good Change okay second my second question is how do you feel about digital onboarding is it better than the previous one to a good extent like as you mention the changes this has upgraded the system to a better performing environment like now we can feel the other person to a good extent okay my third question is like did you did the Adjustment in the size of Avatar adding names according to the person make the system easier and more difficult to use not really like it didn't had a good impact like it's the same as before but the changes I like is only the sound one like the increasing the size of the Avatar didn't had any good impact okay my third is the notification sound made it easier to recognise the other person interaction yeah obviously 100% It's a Good Change okay my next question is did you feel more understood or appreciated that emotional connectivity increase after the changes can you share the specific instance I don't think that the emotional connectivity has been either increased or decreased but somehow I feel connected to the other person due to the sound effect like the emotional connectivity is the same as the previous experiment we did ok have my last question is how did the changes impact the social presence now we can do our task as well and decide this while doing your task we can have an I or hair as well on the other person when he is done or he's not done yet so thank you so much for your time ok
